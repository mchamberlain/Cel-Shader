Cel Shader
==================

A simple GLSL based cel shading example. I originally wrote this in 2007.

Required libraries: OpenGL, GLU, (free)glut, GLEW

* glut/freeglut can be downloaded from here: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
* GLEW can be downloaded from here: http://glew.sourceforge.net/

This program uses GLSL and requires an OpenGL implementation, and hardware, that is compatibale with the OpenGL 2.0 standard and higher.

The model used in the third scene was obtained from: 
http://www.katorlegaz.com/3d_models/ 
and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License and is Copyright © 2003-2012 Andrew Kator & Jennifer Legaz.
It was exported from Blender with a customized raw binary exporter.
